# FirmwareVersionsWrapper

this QT based application copies all Intel Hex firmware files of one user- defined folder into a new .txt file, 
the hex data of each file is separated by user-defined separator strings.
this text file is then uploaded to an ftp server. 
all settings ( server credentials, upload URL, seperator strings, source folder) can be set and saved via
the preferences menu.

this application is the counterpart of my online firmware update application "LordyLink" in which the .txt file is downloaded and parsed into
seperate firmware files onto the client's computer.
